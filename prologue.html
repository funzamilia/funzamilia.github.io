            <p>The year is 450 after the discovery of the Inferus Germen solar system. There are now large settlements on all 10 life supporting planets. The two largest planetary systems are the Planetary Republic of Badenia and its neighbour, the Independent
                Collective of Bavium.</p>
            <p>Every year on a day called proxy the two systems are so close to each other that the planet and moons are clearly visible in the sky of the neighbouring planet. Proxy was celebrated by both sides as a gesture of solidarity and acceptance of
                each otherâ€™s differences. For 450 years this fragile relationship lasted and bared fruit.
            </p>
            <p>On the 450th proxy, the people of Badenia and Bavium saw a different kind of light show in the sky. A more destructive one. It was the moment the greatest interplanetary war was born.</p>
